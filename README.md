# School_District_Analysis
## Overview of the School District 
  The purpose of this excercise was to replace the ninth-grade data from Thomas High School and to compare the data set to the overall data set to detect any signs of potential accademic dishonesty. If there was cheating occuring in this spesific grade, it could artifically inflate the preformance of the school and provide an untruthful representation of the overall preformance of both THomas High School and the district as a whole
## Results
* ![thomas](/Resources/Thomas)
*   After using the data set without the ninth-graders data, there was a steep decrease in the % of students passing math and reading, from an overall percentage of students passing both subjects from 90% down to about 65%. Compared to the other grades at the school, its difficult to think the original pass rate is legitamate with such a steep decrease in preformance at Thomas High School.

* Scores by Spending
*   Across the data set, there seemed to be similar amount of per-capita spending for each student in the district, ranging around $600 per student. The allocation of these resources might differ, where better equipment/materials or higher teacher sallaries could be a factor in the relative test scores that students recieve. However with the current data set spending seem to show a negative trend, where spending more money decreases the overall passing percentage.

* Math and reading Scores by Grade
*   There was an average of around 80-82% of overall passing for reading and 75-80% overall passing for reading. However when looking for students that have passed both the number decreases significantly to around 65%
* Scores by Size
*   Smaller schools preform better than larger schools, and since Thomas High Schools is categorized as a medium school (even after removing the 641 students from the data set) there was still a reasonable preformance at 85% overall passing of both reading and math
* Scores by Type
*   The overall trend of Charter vs District schools remained unaffected by the change in the data set. The top five schools are still charter schools, but Thomas High School has moved down out of the top five preforming schools after the change in the data set, with Wright High School taking over its place with a 90.3% passing rate for both math and reading. Overall the % passing for both subjects at charter schools is still high at 87% while district schools remain unchanged at 54%
## Summary
#   In summary, there seems to be a good arguement for some tampering with the data in the ninth-grade data set. The other 3 grades at Thomas High School have fairly consistent reading and math scores across all 3 levels, around 83% for math and 85% for reading. While the trends above show some evidence that accedemic dishonesty occured, unless there is direct confromation of evidence it is hard to rule out confounding variables to explain these trends. These students might be more organized, or have a very good teacher at the 9th grade level, or the subject material for the ciriculum may be significantly easier. Further investigation is advised to look into Thomas High School and their 9th grade class.
